# Python-OOPs
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs where you create "objects" that represent real-world things. 
These objects have "attributes" (data) that describe them and "behaviors" (code) that define what they can do. 
It's like organizing your code into small, reusable parts that work together.**

Four main types of OOP:
1)Encapsulation:
- Encapsulation means bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
  Example: This OOP hides its internal data and only allows you to interact with it through specific methods, like pressing the button.

2)Abstraction:
- Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
  Example: Think of driving a car. You use the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons, but you don’t need to understand the complex engineering that makes the car run.
  Abstraction in OOP is like this: it hides the complicated details and only exposes the simple, necessary parts to the user.

3)Inheritance:
- Inheritance allows a new class to use the features (properties and methods) of an existing class, making it easier to reuse code and organize classes in a hierarchy.
  But we need to consider the same attributes as parent class.
  Example: In a family where the child inherits characteristics from the parents. 
  In OOP, a new class (child) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent), like a child class inheriting the attributes and methods of its parent class.

4)Polymorphism:
- Polymorphism OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of a common superclass. 
  It enables a single method or function to work in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon.
  Example: Incase of a remote control that can operate different devices like a TV, DVD player, and stereo. The same button can have different effects depending on the device. 
  In polymorphism allows the same method to act differently depending on which object it’s called on, like the remote working with different devices.
